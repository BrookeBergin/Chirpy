# Chirpy Design Document
**Functionality of Chirpy:**
List and briefly describe the functionalities supported by Chirpy. 
  This should include, for example:
- adding a new user and setting its password
- submitting a chirp
- rendering a timeline
- searching for chirps via hashtag
- searching for chirps via chirper (i.e., searching for MicahSherr1's chirps)


Describe the classes that make up the DAO. Class descriptions should include all of the "public" functions that will be used by the BLL. For example, a User class might include functions such as:
- void setUsername( String username )
- String getPassword()
- Class descriptions should include the method names (i.e., the API) and brief descriptions of what each does and what the parameters and return values are.
- Chirpy class; an overarching class for each chirp

- hashtag should be an object
  


**Extra: Support for attaching an image to the Chirp**
